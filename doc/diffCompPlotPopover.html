A strip plot showing the differences between models based on their resampling performance. Since the performances were measured using identical resampled data sets, a statistical tests (here: paired t-test) can be used to evaluate the hypothesis, that the models have equivalent performances (on average), or analogously, that the mean difference in accuracy for the resampled data sets is zero [Hothorn et al (2005) and Eugster et al. 2008]. The resulting confidence interval is multiplicity corrected via Bonferroni.
