A scatter plot matrix for the resampled performance across different models. Each point represents the performance of a model on the hold-out set during resampling. This shows the correlation of the performance between different models. This information is useful in determining models that would show an increased performance in an ensemble. This would include models that are highly uncorrelated, but have a high performance.
