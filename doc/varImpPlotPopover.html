Variable importance evaluation functions can be separated into two groups: those that use the model information and those that do not. In cases where models include a feature selection the importance is computed by a model specific metric and scaled to 100. In cases where features are selected, using a recursive feature elimination approach, a  ROC curve analysis is conducted on each predictor. For two class problems, a series of cutoffs is applied to the predictor data to predict the class. The sensitivity and specificity are computed for each cutoff and the ROC curve is computed. The trapezoidal rule is used to compute the area under the ROC curve. This area is used as the measure of variable importance. For multi-class outcomes, the problem is decomposed into all pair-wise problems and the area under the curve is calculated for each class pair (i.e. class 1 vs. class 2, class 2 vs. class 3 etc.). For a specific class, the maximum area under the curve across the relevant pair-wise AUCâ€™s is used as the variable importance measure.
